#### About
I am a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UCSD studying under the supervision of 
[Jorge Cortes](http://carmenere.ucsd.edu/jorge/index.html). I completed my undergraduate education at UCLA, receiving 
a B.S. in Math and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering in 2018. I am mainly interested in networked systems, which are becoming increasingly important in science and engineering applications (eg. neuroscience, traffic management, power systems). 
My research concerns the modeling and control of such systems, particularly in the context of biological applications, utilizing tools from control theory, optimization, dynamical systems, and network science.
