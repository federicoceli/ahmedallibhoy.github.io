| **Data-based Predictive Control of Linear Network Systems** <br><br> With engineering systems in the twenty-first century becoming more complex, data-driven methods are increasingly relevant as developing models from first-principles is often too difficult. In the context of network systems, the use of data-driven methods raises specific challenges because agents only have access to information that can be measured locally, and must coordinate with one another to predict the network response and decide their control actions. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven predictive control scheme where a network optimization problem is solved in a receding horizon manner, and explore the stability and robustness properties of the resulting controller. | <img src="/assets/complex_traj.png" width="2400px" alt="PRE"> |

| **Primal-dual Dynamics for Safe Online Optimization** <br><br> We investigate the use of primal-dual dynamics to solve constrained optimization problems in real-time. While primal-dual dynamics converge asymptotically to the optimizer under mild-conditions, in real-time applications the dynamics must be terminated after finite-number of iterations. Since there is no guarantee that the primal-dual dynamics will return a feasible solution in finite-time, we augment the primal-dual dynamics to ensure constraint satisfaction at all times along the flow. | <img src="/assets/qlyap.png" width="3200px"> |

| **Bifurcation Analysis of Linear-threshold Networks for Modeling Epilepsy** <br><br> We show that a network of coupled oscillators with linear-threshold nonlinearities can exhibit oscillations that are characterisitc of epileptic seizures, and that the transition from normal to epileptic oscillations can be modeled as a bifurcation in the parameters of the system. This model is used to gain insight into the dynamic mechanisms underlying epileptic seiuzures. | <img src="/assets/spike_and_slow_annotated.png" width="300px"><img src="/assets/slow_wave.png"> ||
